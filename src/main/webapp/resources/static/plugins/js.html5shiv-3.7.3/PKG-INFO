        ************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `html5shiv`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`html5shiv`: https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.html5shiv``) are published to some URL.
        
        Updating
        ========
        
        The lateset version of the library can be downloaded using the following
        commands::
        
            cd js/html5shiv/resources
            wget https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/raw/master/src/html5shiv.js -O html5shiv.js
            wget https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/raw/master/src/html5shiv-printshiv.js -O html5shiv-printshiv.js
            wget https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/raw/master/dist/html5shiv.js -O html5shiv.min.js 
            wget https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/raw/master/dist/html5shiv-printshiv.js -O html5shiv-printshiv.min.js
        
        This will ensure the files are named correctly as the original library names
        both the source and minified versions with the same filenames within its
        repository.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``html5shiv`` from ``js.html5shiv`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.html5shiv import html5shiv
          >>> html5shiv.need()
